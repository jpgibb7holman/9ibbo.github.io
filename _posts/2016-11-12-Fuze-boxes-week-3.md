    <td>Copying the book, then using logic (following the pattern of the previous code) to deal with any problem that we encounter. We would also work together, I was a faster typer than my partner and he was a faster reader, so I typed and he read so we go more work done than we would have done alone.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>We sometimes got stuck on the harder ones which slowed down our progress to the next ones. We made some silly mistakes again which meant we were having to restart the whole thing, which really slowed us down on some of the long ones. We are still getting used to the FUZE boxes though.</td>

    <td>I will try to work quicker and therefore be able to complete more levels. I will also try to solve any problems quicker. As well as all of this, we would also tryto check the work to make sure we have not made any mistakes that would either slow us down or crash the whole programme.</td>
