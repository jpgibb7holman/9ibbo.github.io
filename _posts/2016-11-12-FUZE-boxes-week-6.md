  <tr>
    <td>We learnt by working as quickly as I could, doing the work well, checking it worked and then saving it onto as USB stick. We would then move onto the next bit of work and then repeat the process we would use the book as a guide and then solve any problems we came across.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We were limited by problems that slowed us down a lot.Some of them were just silly mistakes like not reading the book right but others took a bit longer to fix. We are still quite slow at typing so we need to improve that.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We will try to improve our typing speed so we can complete more work and we will also try to make less silly mistakes that were extremely dumb. Then we would try to set higher goals and meet them as well so we would push ourselves more.</td>
  </tr>
