  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by doing as much as I could in the time provided and working quickly and efficiently. We would use the book as a guide while solving any problems we contacted. We would then save each bit of code we completed onto a USB stick and move on to the next one.

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We were limited by the speed at which we typed and spelling errors. Spelling took time to correct and typing slowed us down so that we could not do as much as we could have if we were fast typers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to improve my typing speed and the s[eed I read things out of the booklet at because typing and reading is how we complete each bit of code. I will also try to read the booklet instead of just reading out so I can  understand what I am doing.</td>
