    <td>We made a mistake last lesson so we had to restart the flashing lights project and the picture was tiny, so it was hard to see where all the wires were meant to go. It took a while to get everything in the right place and when they did we then had the problem of the code being in the wrong place. We had put it into editor when it was meant to go into Direct mode.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We were limited by the fact that we had to restart. We had done some time-consuming work the week before and it took as a while to catch up to where we had got to before but when we did we still had 45 minutes left of the lesson. It was hard because I am nearsighted and the because of how small the picture was it took us a while to finish.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We will try not to make any mistakes which would mean we would have to restart the whole thing and then be behind the rest of the class. We would also try to get the lights in the right place so the rest of the project would work better.</td>
