    <td>I learnt by working as quickly as I could while still getting the accuracy right because if we nade one tiny mistake the whole thing would collapse/break. We would copy the book and then check our work to make sure we had not made any silly mistakes that would break it and make us have to redo the whole thing.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We were limited by the few silly mistakes that still creep into our work. We were also limited by the speed at which we checked our work. When we were checking we were quite slow in doing so and that slowed us down quite a bit. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We should try and scan-read the book so we can type what we need to faster. However, doing this could make silly mistakes come in more often so we would need to find a balance between the two. We will also try and get the first part of our blog posts done and then continue with the rest of the lesson.</td>
