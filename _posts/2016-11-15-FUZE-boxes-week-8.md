  <tr>
    <td>I went on to the settings part of the Github website to check what was wrong with my blog, and once I had found that out I went to whatever file and whatever line it was one and tried to fix it. I would then comment the change and go back on to settings to see if it had worked. If there was something else wrong I would repeat the process until everything was fixed.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was limited by the fact that there is a lot of stuff that can go wrong, and the tiniest mistake will break the whole thing. As there was a lot of stuff that could go wrong, it took a while to fix each little error, especially if you had not come across it before. It was also sometimes difficult to see if the changes had actually worked, instead of just not breaking the blog. It sometimes took a while to catch up with the changes I had made and if took a long time you might assume it hadn't worked and change something else, breaking the blog in the process.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try and work quicker, because I had to do a bit of work at home until my blog was working again. As well as this I will try google some of my problems at W3 schools because they are very good for github. </td>
