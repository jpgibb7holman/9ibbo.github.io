    <td>We had to make the lights flash today, as well as typing code into editor, so. It was harder this week. We learn by copying the code from the book and adding all the wires, LED lights and resistors and then making the required edits if we had got anything wrong, After that in part 3 we had to make more than one light flash, which involved the same things but more than once. This was fairly easy as we only had to repeat the work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We were limited by mistakes. Making edits to our work took some time and we would have to do the same for circuits and typed code. This slowed us down a bit but apart form that there was not much else.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We will go more slowly at first which will probably save us time in the end. This would help us because we would not have to make all the edits at the end which were quite time-consuming.</td>
