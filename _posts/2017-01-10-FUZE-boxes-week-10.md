    <td>It was quite hard to see where the different wires and LEDs were meant to go because the picture was quite small, because of this we somethimes got the wires in the wrong place. There was a lot of stuff to do as we had to get all the wire, LEDs and resistors in n the right place and then there was quite a bit of code to do. When we got the wires in the wrong place we would then move them around in the general area until we got them in right places.</td>

    <td>It was hard to see the wires and it took us a while to get them in the right place and then we had to do the code. The code was not very large but there was a lot alternation in the keys so we made a few silly mistakes that would take us a bit of time to fix.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We will make less silly mistakes and we would try to look at the pictures closer so we did not have to move the wires around so much. We would do this because if we made a mistake the whole code would not work and neither would the flashing lights (if we made a mistake in the code the lights would not work and vice versa)</td>
