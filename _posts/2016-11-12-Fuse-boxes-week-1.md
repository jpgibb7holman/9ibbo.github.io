  <tr>
    <td>I was still limited by the fact that I had never used that code before and I made sure I did not give up but used all of my available rescources to complete the excercise without the teachers help.

    <td>I will improve my learning by working quicker so I can get more done and I will change some of the ways I complete the question, such as using logic instead of trial and error all the time.
We also made a mistake at the beginning that was not going into editor so the code woukld not actually work even if we did it right. It took us a while to figure this out but when we did it worked properly. </td>
