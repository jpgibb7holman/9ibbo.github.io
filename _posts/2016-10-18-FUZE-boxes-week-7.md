  <tr>
    <td>We learnt by working quickly and efficiently as quick as we could while still doing the work well, checking everthing was correct and there were no errors and then saving each piece of work onto our memory stick. We would then move on to the next bit of work and repeat the process using the book as a guide and solving any problems we could.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We were limited by the problems we had to solve. Some of them were very time-consuming and took us a while to fix. Some were silly errors like spelling mistakes but others were problems like having trouble setting up the FUZE boxes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We would stop making silly mistakes as often and we will set our goals higher, then try to meet those as well so we can do more work. We will also set up the equipment quicker so we don't waste as much time setting everythinh up.</td>
